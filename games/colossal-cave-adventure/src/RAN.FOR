      INTEGER FUNCTION RAN(RANGE)
      
C  SINCE THE RAN FUNCTION IN LIB40 SEEMS TO BE A REAL LOSER, WE'LL USE ONE OF
C  OUR OWN.  IT'S BEEN RUN THROUGH MANY OF THE TESTS IN KNUTH, VOL. 2 AND
C  SEEMS TO BE QUITE RELIABLE.  RAN RETURNS A VALUE UNIFORMLY SELECTED
C  BETWEEN 0 AND RANGE-1.  NOTE RESEMBLANCE TO ALG USED IN WIZARD.
